This repository contains the code for optimizing escape routes in urban environments. The primary objective of this project is to calculate crowd density from net crowd flow data and provide heuristic-based route recommendations to identify the most efficient paths from a given source to a destination. The implementation aims to enhance urban mobility by considering real-time crowd dynamics.
